# 🏗 Framework Design

## Page Object Model (POM)

Centralized page actions improve maintainability and reduce code duplication.

## Fixtures

Reusable setup layers keep tests clean and scalable.

## Authentication State Management

Authentication is executed once and reused across tests to reduce execution time.

## Utility Layer

Reusable business logic is centralized in utility files.
